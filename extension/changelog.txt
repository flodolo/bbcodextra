Version 0.3.0 - 20100428
* New functionality: Custom Tags (see http://www.yetanothertechblog.com/bbcodextra/)

* Fixed an error in chrome.manifest that caused an XML error on Firefox/SeaMonkey localized in Hebrew (reported by Tomer Cohen of mozilla.org.il).

	** fixed wrong enconding for es-ES (bbcodextra.dtd from ISO-8859-1 to UTF-8, error found thanks to compare-locales)
